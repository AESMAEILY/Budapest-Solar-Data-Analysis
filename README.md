# Budapest Solar Data Analysis ðŸ“ŠðŸŒ…

This project analyzes the changes in **day length** and **solar noon** in Budapest from **June 20, 2022 to December 23, 2022** using the [Sunrise-Sunset API](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api).

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Sunrise-Sunset API
- Time zone localization with `Europe/Budapest`

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Tasks
- Fetched sunrise/sunset data on every 31st day from June to December
- Parsed and converted timestamps
- Visualized the shortening day lengths as the year progresses
- Sorted and filtered data based on day length
- Localized solar noon time to Budapest

## ðŸ“„ Deliverables
- ðŸ“˜ [`Budapest_Solar_Analysis.pdf`](./Budapest_Solar_Analysis.pdf) â€“ Full explanation of the project with visuals and code snippets

## âœ¨ Observations
- Solar noon occurs earlier as the year moves toward winter.
- Day length gradually decreases from over 16 hours to around 8.5 hours.
